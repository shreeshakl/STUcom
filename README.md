Its' a portal for exchanging the study materials.

How it differs from other clouds?
Here people need not to be known others to share files.
Users and upload and download the study materials from the cloud. The uploaded materials will be shared with all the users.  

Note: The remote backend cloud I have used is "Backendless.com". Thay may update Backendless API. Please refer the new API document at Backendless.com for the changes.
